  * Current spm changes color if current spm are lower, equal or higher than desired spm.
  * Show current activity time (chronometer).
  * Star/Stop chronometer and sensors recording.
  * Start/stop button changes color depending if chronometer is stoped or running.
  * Acoustic signal (metronome) to follow the desired spm.
  * Desired SPM selector to configure metronome.
